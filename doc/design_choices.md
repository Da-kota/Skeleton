# Design choices
## This document's purpose
This document gathers the rationales behind the design choices we make. 
This is to keep the source files uncluttered. 
In this document we elaborate on design choices which would otherwise lead to
too much commenting in the source code. 
Quotes of, and references to, knowledge sources can be found in this document.
In the source code we'll then reference specific sections of this document
where applicable.
